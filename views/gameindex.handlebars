Wikipedia was formally launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[26] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[22] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"[27] was codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[22] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.[28]

Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. By August 8, 2001, Wikipedia had over 8,000 articles.[29] On September 25, 2001, Wikipedia had over 13,000 articles.[30] By the end of 2001 it had grown to approximately 20,000 articles and 18 language editions. It had reached 26 language editions by late 2002, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161 by the final days of 2004.[31] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing even the 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia, which had held the record for almost 600 years.[32]

Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[33] These moves encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and to change Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.[34]

Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.[35] Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.[36] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.[37] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called "low-hanging fruit"—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.[38][39][40]
